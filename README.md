XML vs. Message Pack Serialization Comparison

XML(Extensible Markup Language) - Text Format

XML is a markup language much like HTML, was designed to store and transport data and to be both human and machine-readable.

Message Pack - Binary Format 

MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format. 
It lets you exchange data among multiple languages like JSON. 
But it's faster and smaller.
